Kingbash - menu driven auto-completion
======================================

from the discussion thread at https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=101010

There once was archlinux user kokoko3k who posted on 2010-07-14: "One of the
things i really missed from my glorious amigaos system was the kingcon terminal
emulator (![KingCON Screenshot][1],[2]). It featured a simple and useful file
browser when autocompletion was requested."
Thus, he posted a script for similar use, written in gambas.

A day later, fellow user Procyon followed up with a python version which he
kept working on until he stated that he had "actually started working on a
minimal rewrite in bash, because the python script is huge and I don't
understand it at all anymore. I hope it will be faster too."

Then on 2013-01-24, he posted the first version of it, followed by several
updates on the same thread. Beginning of 2014, a git repository was set up for
KingBash to enable distributed development and issue tracking. The commit
entries have been quoted from the respective posts.

You are invited to fork this, post issues and implement features as you see fit.
